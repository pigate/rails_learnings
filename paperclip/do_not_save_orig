#resize image to fit width, center, then crop photo (#)
#auto ensures original is saved as this style. Can add more style if wanted, 
but if original is tiny, will derive off the original. may get grainier and granier


class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_attached_file :photo,
    :styles => {
     :original => "100x100#"
    },
    :convert_options => {
      :thumb => "-quality 75 -strip" #save some room by stripping some quality
    },
    :default_url => "missing_persons.png" #store in app/assets/images

  has_attached_file :avatar,
    :styles => {
      :original => "400x600^" #fill
    },
    :default_url => 'missing.png"

I believe that you can simply define a style for :original to have paperclip replace the original with that size.

:styles => { :original => '300x168>', :cropped_thumb => {:geometry => "115x70#",
 :jcrop => true}, ...}
