#src: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9552413/how-do-i-pass-in-a-parameter-to-a-hidden-field-tag-in-my-form-in-rails-3

In my /users/show.html.erb I have:

<%= link_to 'Send a message', new_message_path %>

And in my /messages/new.html.erb:

<%= simple_form_for @message, :url => messages_path, :method => :post do |f| %>
   <%= hidden_field_tag :user_id %> 
   <%= f.input :body %>
   <%= f.submit %>
 <% end %>

And my messages controller:

def new
  @message = ActsAsMessageAble::Message.new
 end

 def create
   @to = User.find(params[:user_id])
   current_user.send_message(@to, params[:body])
 end

figure out how to pass the param into that hidden_field_tag in the form

problem was that :user_id in <%= hidden_tag_field :user_id %> wasn't being set


Some of the solutions we tried were to include the params in the link_to but that didn't sit well with the form which saw the object as nil.

What I ended up doing was creating a nested resource like so:

resources :users do
   resources :messages do
   end
 end

this ultimately gave me the url: users/:id/messages/new (new_user_message_path)

My controller ended up looking like this:

def new
   @message = ActsAsMessageable::Message.new
   @user = params[:user_id]
 end

 def create
   @to = User.find params[:id]
   if current_user.send_message(@to, params[:acts_as_messageable_message][:body]
     flash[:notice] = "Success"
   else 
     flash[:error] = "Fail"
   end
 end

In the form I was able to leave <%= hidden_tag_field :user_id %>
