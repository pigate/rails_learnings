<%= form_tag language_path, :method => :post do %>
  <%= label_tag :language_english, 'English' %>
  <%= radio_button_tag :language, 'english' %>
  <%= label_tag :language_french, 'French' %>
  <%= radio_button_tag :language, 'french' %>
  <%= submit_tag %>
<% end %>

Where language_path is the path defined in your routes.rb, such as

match "/home/language" => "home#language", :as => 'language'

	
form_for does not take a path as an argument, but a record. I guess you meant form_tag?
