To get part of a hash, can slice in rails, or delete in ruby
#in rails
> first = {:a => 1, :c => 2, :e => 3, :d => 4}
> second = first.slice(:a, :c, :e)
    second = {:a => 1, :c => 2, :e => 3}
#in ruby
> second = first.delete_if { |k, v| ![:a, :c, :e].include?(k) }
> second = first.delete_if { |k| ![:a, :c, :e].include?(k) }

> second = first.delete_if { |key, value| key == :e || key == :d }
