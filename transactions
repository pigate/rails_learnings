Use transactions when
1. updating multiple records at one time


Common Anti-patterns To Avoid

    Using a transaction when only a single record is updated
    Needlessly nesting transactions
    Transactions that contain code, which wonâ€™t cause a rollback
    Use of transactions in a controller
