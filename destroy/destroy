On a Rails' model association you can specify the :dependent option, which can take one of the following three forms:

[1]    :destroy/:destroy_all The associated objects are destroyed alongside this object by calling their destroy method
[2]    :delete/:delete_all All associated objects are destroyed immediately without calling their :destroy method
[3]    :nullify All associated objects' foreign keys are set to NULL without calling their save callbacks



class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :microposts, dependent: :destroy #<---when destroy User, destroys their posts too
  .
  .
  .
end
