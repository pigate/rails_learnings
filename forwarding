If not using devise, make a sessions model, and create its controller.
Otherwise, if [USING DEVISE], see devise/forwarding for an example.

Only if SessionsHelper is included in ApplicationsHelper

Controllers cannot call stuff from these helpers.

If want controller to call some global method, put the methods in ApplicationsController


module SessionsHelper
  .
  .
  .
  def deny_access
    store_location
    redirect_to signin_path, :notice => "Please sign in to access this page."
  end

  def redirect_back_or(default)
    redirect_to(session[:return_to] || default)
    clear_return_to
  end

  private
    .
    .
    .
    def store_location
      session[:return_to] = request.fullpath
    end

    def clear_return_to
      session[:return_to] = nil
    end
end

class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  .
  .
  .
  def create
    user = User.authenticate(params[:session][:email],
                             params[:session][:password])
    if user.nil?
      flash.now[:error] = "Invalid email/password combination."
      @title = "Sign in"
      render 'new'
    else
      sign_in user
      redirect_back_or user
    end
  end
  .
  .
  .
end

class UsersController < ...
  before_filter :authenticate, :only => [:edit, :update]
  def authenticate
    deny_access unless signed_in?
  end
end
