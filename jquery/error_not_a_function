Problem: $(...).infinitescroll is not a function

Situation: using coffeescript to generate my javascript
Took off turbolinks so that I can use $(document).ready


HOw I fixed: 
Got rid of coffeescript. Converted back to actual javascript <-- Works!
Coffeescript was adding junk and made it break :(

possible: but didn't actually happen...


could be jquery loading twice. 
From precompilation
and other stuff.



I went into tmp/ and deleted some stuff in there

#jQuery ->
$(document).ready ->
  $("#movies_scroll .page").infinitescroll
    navSelector: "nav.pagination" # selector for the paged navigation (it will be hidden)
    nextSelector: "nav.pagination a[rel=next]" # selector for the NEXT link (to page 2)
    itemSelector: "#movies_scroll div.movie_blob_wrapper" # selector for all items you'll retrieve
