#assumes you have a users_controller
To create other users, just enable the users#destroy
I chose to only allow delete for other users on the users#show page.

#app/views/users/show.html.erb
<% if (current_user.try(:admin?) && current_user != @user)  || current_user == @user%>
  <%= link_to "delete", @user, :action => :destroy, :method => :delete, :confirm => "You sure?" %>
<% end %>


vs. 

#app/views/users/index.html.erb
<%= link_to 'Destroy Yourself', user_registration_path, :method => :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
