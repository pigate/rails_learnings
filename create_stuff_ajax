#if using some sort of form to create object, if want, when create, to stay on page and possibly call on something java-y to happen, do the following:

app/views/users/_form.html.erb
<%= form_for(@user, :remote => true) do |f| %>

...
  <div class="actions">
   <%= f.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>

#when this submits, say, we want some js to be called. 
#in app/controllers/users_controller.rb
def create
  #add this if not there
  respond_to do |format| #it responds to submit from forms
    if @user.save #success!
      format.html { redirect_to users_path, notice: "User creation success!"}
      format.json { render :show, status: :created, location: @user}
      format.js #this is the most important!
        #when add this, when form submitted, controller looks automatically to 
        #  create.js.erb for js to execute
	#note, ^------method name
    else
     #do other stuff...
    end
  end
end

#Now you have to have create.js.erb sitting in same folder as the view
#  app/views/users/create.js.erb
$().function stuff!!! yay!!!
