Can use a polymorphic relationship for a model that belongs to multiple types.

Polymorphism: An OOP concept in which a common interface is used to multiple model types.

In other languages, the interface will provide common methods, accessors, etc.

Run-time typing.


In RoR, on the surface, a model type object can only belong to 1 type at a time, not multiple types at a time. So, we let it believe so, by 

eg)

Comment can belong to MovieReview, UserProfilePage, or TheatreReview

rails g model Comment comment_text:text commentable_id:integer commentable_type:string

class Comment
  belongs_to :commentable, :polymorphic => true
end

class MovieReview
 has_many :comments, as: => :commentable
end

class UserProfilePage
  has_many :comments, as: => :commentable
end

class TheatreReview
  has_many :comments, as: => :commentable
end
